  <h1 class="first"> I'm sick?!</h1>
  <p class="second">Heyyy. This is my first entry! Yay! So excited to already start writing! I think I’m
     just going to talk about my current status. So though the last couple of years I have
      been feeling really strong heat waves. At first I didn’t know why, but then I realized 
      that the more inventions humans created, the hotter I got. As time passed I believe
       humans noticed the hotness of the climate that I was generating and the scientist 
       started studying me. It turned out that I was suffering from something they called
        “global warming”. According to them, it is like a fever I’m having, but there’s no
         immediate medicine to cure it! I’m actually really scared, the more time passes 
         the worse I am feeling. I heard rumors that a group of humans were trying to save me. I’ll keep you updated soon to see what happens.
