  <h1 class="first"> It may be my cure after all...</h1>
  <p class="second">Hello again! So let me tell you what the group of humans did! 
    Apparently what is causing my high fever is caused by the increase of 
    greenhouse gases in my atmosphere, which makes the heat stay trapped inside
     of me instead of getting out. I knew I wanted to just imagine everything… 
     However, it doesn’t seem to be a quick cure to it, instead it takes a really 
     long process for me to feel better. But for that to happen everybody needs to help me. 
     They gave me a list of things humans need to do to help me feel better and I’m gonna
      share some with you here:
