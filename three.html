  <h1 class="first"> DIY’s that don’t hurt me!</h1>

  <p class="second">I recently discovered that humans do something called “Do It Yourself” or
     DIY for short. I really love creating things like this so I believe this is an 
     amazing idea. I looked up a couple of DIY projects with reused things that you may
      have at home. That way those objects can have another life and they will not affect
       me on those horrible trash lands… Anyway, these are my favs!
